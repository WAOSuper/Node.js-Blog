Node.js simple blog
=============

A sample blog built with [Node.js], [Express], [MongoDB] ([Mongoose]).

Setup
-------

First, you have to install Node.js (a prefered way is using [nvm]). Then do the following steps.

	npm install
	node app.js

You should also install MongoDB on your server.
Then visit [http://localhost:3000].

TODO
-------

As a practice, you may add the following features yourself.

* CRUD support for comments (CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.)
* Authentication
* Form validation
* Perhaps a better routing logic
